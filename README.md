# Fashion_Item_Classification

Here's a sample README.md file you can use for your GitHub project that loads and uses the MNIST (or Fashion MNIST) dataset from raw .idx files.

üß† Fashion Item Classifier (MNIST from .idx Files)
This project demonstrates how to load the MNIST or Fashion MNIST dataset from raw .idx files and build a basic neural network classifier using TensorFlow/Keras. It can be extended to any .idx-formatted dataset.

üìÅ Dataset
We use the raw .idx format of the MNIST dataset:

train-images-idx3-ubyte

train-labels-idx1-ubyte

t10k-images-idx3-ubyte

t10k-labels-idx1-ubyte

You can download the files from Yann LeCun's website or use your own exported .idx files.
